touch file1 file2
cp file1 file2      (copy source to destination)
cp file1 dir1 

cat dir1/file1 

cp -R dir1 dir2        (copy content from dir1 to dir2 recursively)

mv file1 dir2       (move file1 to dir2)
mv file1 file3      (rename from file1 to file3)

find  / -options filename   (options: -name, -user, -group)
-name: for searching a file with its name 
-user: For files whose owner is a particular user 
-group: for files belonging to particular group 

- find / -name file1

diff file1 file2    (compare content of file1 and file2)

file file1      (find what kind of file is this)

*****************
- grep hello file1          #find hello in file1
- grep Permit /etc/ssh/sshd_config      #check if PermitRootLogin is yes or no in sshd_config
- grep Permit -i /etc/ssh/sshd_config   (ignore case)
- grep ^t file1     #search for all lines which start with t 

- ls -l | grep environment      (ls -l will output as a file and grep will take from it. grep cannot directly
                                search directory)
- ls -l | grep ^d       (get only those file which have d at the beginning)

******************
sed command( stream editor is used to search a word in the file and replace it with the word required to 
be in the output)

Note : it will only modify the output, but there will be no change in the original file 

eg: 
    sed 's/old_text/new_text/' file_name        #Hi with Hello 
    sed 's/old_text/new_text/g' file_name       # here if it finds Hi with other word then also it will change it
    sed -i 's/old_text/new_text/' file_name     #this command will update in file also. above 2 will only display in std output
