gzip        (create a compressed file)
gunzip      (unzip a file)
tar         (extract tar file)

gzip file1
gunzip file1 
tar -cvf dir1.tar dir1        (create verbose and file)
tar -xvf dir1.tar       (extract dir1.tar)
gzip dir1.tar   (normally we cannot gzip directory but if we take tar of that directory then it will
                work with gzip)
output -> dir1.tar.gz
tar -xvzf dir1.tar.gz       (it will uzip and it is going to extract)

Crontab
-------
in any operating system, it is possible to create jobs that you want it to reoccur. This process known as 
job scheduling, is usually done based on user-defined jobs. For redhat or any other linux, this process is 
handled by the cron service or a daemon called crond, which can be used to schedule tasks

link files
----------
2 links - soft links and hard links

soft link
---------
* If you need same file in different locations(by this way we can reduce space utilization)  
* It can also be used to create a shortcuts to execute our scripts. if we want the script to get executed 
    from anywhere, we can use softlink
* Soft link - size of lik file is equal to no of characters in the name of original file 
* if original file is deleted, link is broken and data is lost
* command: ln -s <src_file> <dest_file>
ln -s file1 file11

hard link
---------
size of both file is same 
if original file is deleted then also link will contain data 
Command: ln <src_file> <dest_file>

scp 
---
scp file1 root@10.20.40.30:/tmp
scp root@10.20.40.30:/tmp /home/ec2-user/
