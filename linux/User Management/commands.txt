super orroot user: user is the most powerful user. He is the administrator user  
system user: users created by the softwares or applications

User creation 
-------------
Whenever a user is created in linux, below things happen by default 
    - a home directory is created (/home/username)
    - unique UID & GID are given to user 
    - An entry in /etc/passwd 

useradd <option> <username>

Options are:
------------
    -u user id 
    -G Secondary group id 
    -g primary group id 
    -d home directory 
    -c comment 
    -s shell  

File Permissions 
----------------
Permissions are applied at 3 levels:
    * Owner or user level 
    * Group level 
    * Other level 

Permissions are applied in 3 ways:
    * r - Read only 
    * w - write/edit/append/delete 
    * x - Execute/Run 

-rwxrw-r-- = - file | d (directory) | b block file(harddisk, floppy disk) | c character file(keyboard, mouse) | l link files 
           = rwx(owner permissions) = owner has all read write execute permissions(- in case if null)
           = rw- (group permissions) = users who will be in root group will get read and write but not execute 
           = r-- (others permissions)

File permissions 
----------------
Access modes are different on file and directory 

permission 
----------
    file                                    dir
r - open the file                       ls the contents of dir 
w - write, edit, append, delete file    Add/Del/Rename contents of dir 
x - To run a command/shell scripts      To enter into dir using 'cd'

permission can be set on any file/dir by using 2 methods: 
* symbolic methods(ugo)  
* absolute method (numbers) 

symbolic method                                     absolute method 
---------------                                     ---------------
#chmod [who] [+/-/=] [permissions] file             we use numbers instead of using symbols 
who: to whom the permissions to be assigned         Read - 4 
permissions: users/owner(u):group(g);others(o)      Write - 2 
example:                                            Execute - 1 
    #chmod u=rwx, g=rw,o=r <file_name>              chmod 764 <file_name>
    #chmod ugo=rwx <file_name>                      chmod 777 <file_name>

chmod u+x, g-w,o=w file1 
chmod 755 file1 

give permission to a specific user
